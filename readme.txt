Childboards as Dropdown allows you to convert the normal list of Child Boards into a dropdown input to conserve space and improve the forum layout.

You can enable or disable this modification from the admin panel.  In addition, you can define a number of childboards allowed to be displayed normally, before that board is converted to the new layout.  This allows you to only convert boards with "X" amount of childboards to a dropdown so boards with few childboards still display normally.  You do have the option to over-ride and have all boards convert to the new layout however.

As of version 2.0.0, the modification was completely re-written, functions with JavaScript disabled, and covers both the BoardIndex, and the MessageIndex.
